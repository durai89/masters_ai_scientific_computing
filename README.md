                                        Differential Calculus:

For a small tiny nudge in x (dx), the percentage change in height caused is given by it's derivative.

If a tangent line is drawn towards the graph, the rise over run(ie. slope of the tangent line to the graph)  gives
the derivative of the function.

To work out the area enclosed under a function(i.e integral), the area under the curve is segmented into number of
smaller rectangles. If the rectangles are very small, the approximated area computed will be very accurate.

Hence dx should be infinitesimally small i.e as dx approach 0. This concept of dx approaching 0 but not zero is the concept
of limits. As per L'Hopital's rule, derivative is given as lim (h->0) ((f(x+h) - f(x))/f(h))

If the second derivative of df/dx is 0, then the slope of the first derivative has hit the maximum point  if we
further progress and slope increases. If the slope decreases then it is minima.  This is the main concept in machine
learning techniques like gradient descent where weights are optimized with this technique

In case of non-uniform curve, there can be number of local minima, local maxima and can be only one global minima/maxima
This is the main concept behind stochastic gradient descent.

                                        Integral Calculus:

The area computed under the graph is given by its integration. If we keep one point fixed and slide another point, the
area enclosed under a graph between these two points is given by its definite integral.rectangles

Definite integral is given as f(b) - f(a) where b and a are upper and lower bound limits.rectangles

Integrals are the opposite of derivative and they are called as anti-derivative. For. eg. differentiation of speed
gives us a velocity function whereas integral of it gives us the speed.

The area under the curve or the integral can be approximated with Reimmans technique. Reimmans technique can be classified
as Left Reimman sum & Right Reimman sum.

Left Reimman - If we start drawing smaller rectangles from the upper bound limit to lower limit, then the rectangles drawn
point towards the left slide

Right Reimman - If we start drawing smaller rectangles from the lower bound limit to upper limit, then the rectangles drawn
point towards the right side

There are other approximation techniques like
  a. Midpoint Rule
  b. Trapezoidal Rule
  c. Simpson Rule
